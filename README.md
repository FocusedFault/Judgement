# Judgement

Monsoon difficulty is forced, compatible with Mithrix mods (Umbral, Inferno, AotK). You have 0 natural regen. Your HP persists between stages. You'll have a 3 use full heal station. No multiplayer support (for now)

There are a total of 5 rounds then you fight Mithrix at the end. Each round consists of a regular enemy wave and a boss wave then you move onto another stage for the next round (10 total waves). You start out with a red item and an equipment. At the start of every round you'll start in the bazaar where you choose items and some items that were previously useless now have a function at the bazaar (keys, form, regen scrap). At the end of the 10th wave you'll get 1 last round of items then you'll be teleported to fight Mithrix.
