# Judgement

Monsoon difficulty is forced, compatible with Mithrix mods (Umbral, Inferno, AotK). You have 0 natural regen.

There are a total of 5 rounds then you fight Mithrix at the end. Each round consists of a regular enemy wave and a boss wave then you move onto another stage for the next round (10 total waves). You start out with a red item and an equipment. At the start of every round afterwards you'll get 4 items (2 white, 2 greens with a 10% chance to be red instead). At the end of the 10th wave you'll get 1 last round of items then you'll be teleported to immediately fight Mithrix.
